Assignment Task 

There are two csv files to be analyzed.  The assignment requires using git to create local files.  Using python language to write coding for analysis aims. The final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.  

 

Instructions 

1. First of all, I write the file path with real path in my pc, e.g. C:/User/shadow/python-challenge. It can be processed by terminal well, and I do not know why assignment requires creating files in such way, e.g. python-challenge/pybank/main.py, python-challenge/pybank/resources, python-challenge/pybank/analysis. Until I prepared to upload coding to GitHub, it failed that python cannot find csv file’s path. Then I researched on websites and knew what relative path was. The relative path requires that kind of file path structure. And I knew how to write relative path syntax. 

2. The pybank is the first task I did. Based on VBA’s acknowledge I’ve learned. I figured out that dictionary and loop are the main solution for this task.  I wrote dictionary and loop coding based on class learning.  However, the “Amount": float("-inf")” in "GIP = {"Date": "","Amount": float("-inf")}” is what I learned from ChatGPT. This kind of method gives way that makes initial value of variable to be the negative maximum so that the loop function could work correct and make sure any increase in profit and loss can be recorded successfully.  

3. The most interesting thing that happened was when I coded and ran in terminal 73 of main.py under pybank. I was pretty sure that I wrote the correct code. But when the result came out, it was not the same as it should be on the bootcamp website.  I really got stuck for a long time in this point. After so much research, I figured it out that the code should not be included in the if function. And then I learned that the format and the blank space are so important in python. 

4. “newline=""” in line 33, it is an optional function to ensure consistent handling of line endings across different platforms (like Windows, Unix, etc.) It is not necessary based on the date file of pybank, I wrote there just for learning and developing good habit. 

5. The Pyroll is pretty similar to Pybank. I used the same function and method to finish it. 

 

Declaration 

During the task, I used some syntax, formula and functions. Some of them from class, some of them from web search. When I made an error or had no idea what was going on, I chatted with ChatGPT and got some suggestions or debug for coding. I figured the problem out first and understood it, and then typed code down. From this view, my work might have some similarity with others. I am a new learner on coding, have to do lots of research and reading for problem solving.
